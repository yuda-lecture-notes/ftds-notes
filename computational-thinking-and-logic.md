# Computational Thinking and Logic

## Computational Thinking
- **Computational Thinking** is the process of identifying a clear **step-by-step solution** to a complex problem. ([reference](https://www.bbc.co.uk/bitesize/guides/zp92mp3/revision/1))
- Computational thinking allows us to take a complex problem, understand what the problem is and develop possible solutions.
- There are 4 techniques of computational thinking
  - Decomposition
  - Pattern Recognition: 
  - Abstraction
  - Algorithms
- Computational thinking involves taking that complex problem and breaking it down into a series of small, more manageable problems (**decomposition**). Each of these smaller problems can then be looked at individually, considering how similar problems have been solved previously (**pattern recognition**) and focusing only on the important details, while ignoring irrelevant information (**abstraction**). Next, simple steps or rules to solve each of the smaller problems can be designed (**algorithms**).

## Computational Logic
- **Computational Logic** is a term that describes the **decision-making** process used in programming and writing algorithms. ([reference](https://www.theschoolrun.com/what-computational-logic))

## Flowchart
- **Flowchart** is a diagram that depicts a process, system or computer algorithm.
